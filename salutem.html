<h1 id="2022-04-update">Maemo Leste update 2022-04</h1>

We have published a major update to our mobile operating system, check it out
<a href="https://maemo-leste.github.io/maemo-leste-sixteenth-update-november-and-december-2021-january-april-2022.html">here</a>.

<h1 id="expand-the-root-partition-to-fill-sd-card">Expand partition to fill SD card</h1>

<p>A helpful script is included to expand the root partition to fill the microSD card.
After booting and logging in to root, execute: /etc/expandcard.sh</p>
<p>This will expand the root partition to fill the microSD card using resize2fs.</p>

<h1 id="-ssh-login-">(SSH) Login</h1>
<p>User credentials are: &#39;&#39;&#39;user:user&#39;&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>Root credentials are: &#39;&#39;&#39;root:toor&#39;&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>You should prefer logging in as user and then escalating to root with sudo as necessary.</p>
<p>In images newer than 17 January 2021, root SSH is disabled by default.</p>

<h1 id="useful-bits">Useful Bits</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Default lockcode is &quot;12345&quot;</li>
    <li>Lockcode can only be changed if your hardware has CAL. QEMU does not have CAL. Droid 4 also not.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="activating-some-swap">Activating some swap</h1>
<p>You can install &#39;&#39;&#39;zram-tools&#39;&#39;&#39; from the repo, and
edit &#39;&#39;&#39;/etc/default/zramswap&#39;&#39;&#39; as necessary. It&#39;s
probably convenient to set allocation to 1024.
hildon-base (and it&#39;s hildon-env-setup initscript) are aware if zramswap in
installed and will activate zram.  If you have an image older than 17 January
2021, you should remove the existing zram initscript and install zram-tools to
utilize this functionality.</p>

<h2 id="remove-it-with-">Remove it with:</h2>
<pre> rc-update del zram<br>
rm /etc/init.d/zram</pre>
