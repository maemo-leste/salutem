<p>A helpful script is included to expand the root partition to fill the microSD card.
After booting and logging in to root, execute: /etc/expandcard.sh</p>
<p>This will expand the root partition to fill the microSD card using resize2fs.</p>

<p>User credentials are: &#39;&#39;&#39;user:user&#39;&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>Root credentials are: &#39;&#39;&#39;root:toor&#39;&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>You should prefer logging in as user and then escalating to root with sudo as necessary.</p>

<p>You can install &#39;&#39;&#39;zram-tools&#39;&#39;&#39; from the repo, and edit &#39;&#39;&#39;/etc/default/zramswap&#39;&#39;&#39; as necessary. It&#39;s probably convenient to set allocation to 1024.
hildon-base (and it&#39;s hildon-env-setup initscript) are aware if zramswap in installed and will activate zram.
If you have an image older than 17 January 2021, you should remove the existing zram initscript and install zram-tools to utilize this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="remove-it-with-">Remove it with:</h2>
<p> rc-update del zram
 rm /etc/init.d/zram</p>
